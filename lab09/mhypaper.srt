00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,740
when a character motion is given

3
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,049
authoring Garman animation for the

4
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,940
character is one of the fundamental

5
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,849
steps in a computer animation industry a

6
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:14,280
traditional workflow for doing this is

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,370
time and labor consuming the designer is

8
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,680
asked to insert keyframes by manually

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,720
editing the mesh with predefined

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,779
controllers the keyframes are inserted

11
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:28,300
densely and will be connected via linear

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,700
interpolation for animation

13
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:34,910
in a traditional workflow it takes more

14
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:39,730
than 40 hours for an expert to compose a

15
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,680
gamma animation with 400 frames

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,070
with our proposed workflow these tacks

17
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:50,430
can be finished within five minutes here

18
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:53,140
we show our workflow with the Maya

19
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:57,860
plugin we developed for our system first

20
00:00:53,860 --> 00:01:01,000
we load a body motion of the character

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,420
here we preview the body motion

22
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:08,229
now we insert one keyframe we first

23
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:11,060
select the location of the keyframe

24
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,150
select a candidate garment shape predict

25
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:16,819
in transect parameters and propagate to

26
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:19,580
the whole sequence for more technical

27
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:22,700
details please refer to our paper now we

28
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,369
check the result of our gamma animation

29
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:28,369
prediction we can continue to insert new

30
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:32,670
keyframes for example for frame 1 7 and

31
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:34,000
and 75 we are not satisfied with the

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,880
current garment prediction we may mark

33
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,489
it as a keyframe and select a new

34
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:42,160
Kennedy from the data set we may

35
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,410
continue this until the animation

36
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:47,690
sequence is satisfactory

37
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:50,479
we may also delayed a keyframe if we

38
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:54,090
don't want it any more in a continue to

39
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,220
insert new keyframes if necessary

40
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,220
here we show our final garment animation

41
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,489
result

42
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:11,758
once the garmin animation is created our

43
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,310
system can update it automatically

44
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:18,889
whence the underlying body motion has

45
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:21,599
been changed here we added about emotion

46
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:24,419
and a garmin animation is updated

47
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:26,060
accordingly here first show the

48
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,910
animation without updating it has

49
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:32,849
significant artifact as the gamma motion

50
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:35,340
is not aligned with the new body motion

51
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,819
now we update a gamma animation the new

52
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:41,280
Garmin is moving naturally according the

53
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:45,160
body motion why the previous designs are

54
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,818
kept without any further menu effort

55
00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:51,400
here we visualized a garment change

56
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,829
during the editing process by comparing

57
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:58,400
SI by Sai here on the left is to input

58
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,310
body motion on the right we have a

59
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:03,468
keyframe inserted at the beginning

60
00:03:00,468 --> 00:03:05,530
marked as a red on the timeline the

61
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,539
Leighton parameters I learned from that

62
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:10,818
keyframe and are used to generate

63
00:03:07,818 --> 00:03:12,489
garment shape for other frames when

64
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:15,949
inserting a new keyframe we see that a

65
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:17,169
gamma shape is the same at the beginning

66
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:20,959
and changing smoothly towards the second

67
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:20,509
key free

68
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:29,509
now the video is paused at the second

69
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:32,729
keyframe to see the difference between

70
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:34,370
the left and right the change happens

71
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,348
since we have learned a new latent

72
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:39,810
parameter for the second keyframe and

73
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:42,389
interpolate the parameter in the latent

74
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:45,000
space the new latent parameter will be

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,680
used for the rest of animation

76
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,019
it is similar when inserting more

77
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,870
keyframes

78
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,289
you

79
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:04,049
here we show the result when updating

80
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:07,750
about emotion the yellow region on the

81
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:10,030
timeline marks where the body motion has

82
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:13,120
been changed now on a ride only the body

83
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,348
motion has been changed

84
00:04:13,348 --> 00:04:19,930
now the gamma motion has also been

85
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,519
updated or Prada Li

86
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:26,439
you

87
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:34,300
instead of selecting a caddy for

88
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:36,478
keyframe our system also supports Dirac

89
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,728
shape editing when inserting a new

90
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:41,829
keyframe

91
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:45,288
here we come here to Gama che between

92
00:04:41,288 --> 00:04:48,639
the first before editing the second mesh

93
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:50,579
editing and the third projecting the

94
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:53,860
Edit mesh into our Laden space and

95
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:56,860
projected back into 3d space using on a

96
00:04:53,860 --> 00:05:00,918
trend Network the second row shows the

97
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:02,190
mesh quality we show the animation

98
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,649
before and after the editing side by

99
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:09,680
side the two animation star at the same

100
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,339
keyframe and at the same keyframe but

101
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:13,168
the frame at the midpoint has been

102
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:16,959
changed and marked as a keyframe here we

103
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:19,870
show another example in this case the

104
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:22,360
menu editing creates a lot of artifacts

105
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,538
on a gamma shape so the Edit mesh is far

106
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:27,879
from what we have in a training data set

107
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:30,759
our approach captures the trend of this

108
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,190
editing but has some artifacts such as

109
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:36,038
self intersection when projecting it

110
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:38,478
back to the 3d shape space

111
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,879
here we show more examples with

112
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,740
different garments and different

113
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,680
characters we show a side-by-side

114
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,209
comparison of two animations starting

115
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:50,699
from the say keyframe but ending with

116
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,680
two different keyframes

117
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,598
you

118
00:05:58,598 --> 00:06:04,269
here we come here a sequence of ground

119
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:06,360
true simulation in our data set and a

120
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,038
reconstruction through our learned

121
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:08,579
latent space

122
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:16,060
you

123
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,699
since our system is only driving by a

124
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:25,850
fixed period of previous body motion one

125
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:29,860
application is to create garment

126
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,709
movement for Lube animation

127
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:38,000
thank you for watching
